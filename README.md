# leap-year
<p align="center">Certainly! This Python script consists of two functions and a main code section:

### 1. `is_leap_year(year)` Function:
   - **Purpose:** Determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.
   - **Conditions for Leap Year:**
      - Divisible by 4
      - Not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400
   - **Return Value:**
      - `True` if the conditions for a leap year are met.
      - `False` otherwise.

### 2. `leap_year(century)` Function:
   - **Purpose:** Generates a list of leap years for a specified century.
   - **Logic:**
      - Iterates through the years in the specified century using a `for` loop.
      - Calls the `is_leap_year` function to check if each year is a leap year.
      - If a year is a leap year, it is added to the `years` list.
   - **Return Value:** A list containing leap years in the specified century.

### 3. Main Code:
   - **User Input:**
      - Prompts the user to enter a century using `input()`.
   - **Function Call:**
      - Calls the `leap_year` function with the user-inputted century.
   - **Output:**
      - Prints the list of leap years generated by the `leap_year` function.

### 4. Comments:
   - Throughout the code, comments are provided to explain the purpose of each function and to describe the logic behind the leap year conditions.

### Example:
   - If the user enters "20" for the century, the script will calculate and display the leap years in the 20th century.

This script is a simple leap year calculator that allows users to find leap years within a specified century. The functions make the code modular and reusable, and comments enhance code readability and understanding.</p>
